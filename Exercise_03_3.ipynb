    "The data is taken from a two-dimensional probability distribution and is represented by the value pairs $x_1$ and $x_2$. The regions $x1$, $x_2 > 0$ and $x_1$, $x_2 < 0$ are shown by one color. For value pairs with $x_1 > 0$, $x_2 < 0$ and $x_1 < 0$, $x_2 > 0$, the regions are indicated by a different color.  \n",

    "In features, select the two independent variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ and start the network training. The network learns that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are for these data not independent variables, but are taken from the probability distribution of the checkerboard pattern.\n",
