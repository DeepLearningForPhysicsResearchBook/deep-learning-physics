    "  * W: (number of hidden nodes, number of inputs) named `W`\n",

    "   * Now you can use the code below (training loop and evaluation) to train the network for multiple data points and even over several epochs. Try to find a set of hyperparameters (number of nodes in the hidden layer, learning rate, number of training epochs) that gives stable results. What is the best result (as measured by the loss on the training sample) you can get?"
