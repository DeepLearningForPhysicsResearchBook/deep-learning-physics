    "\n",
    "Congratulations - you have successfully navigated to the exercise page for the book **Deep Learning for Physics Research** \n",
    "\n",
    "This page hosts additional descriptions as well (where appropriate) example solutions to the exercise problems. While the solutions are available, we recommend you first attempt to solve the problem yourself, before looking up the answer. As many problems are open-ended, the presented solution of course often only represents one possible option how the problem could be solved.\n",
